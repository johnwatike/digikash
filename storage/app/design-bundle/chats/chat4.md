Design a "Gift Card" feature for a Laravel fintech web application called Digikash.
The stack uses Blade templates + Tailwind CSS 3 + Alpine.js. The existing UI style 
uses a custom design system with Bootstrap-like utility classes (col-lg-*, btn, 
form-control, single-form-card, summery-list, etc.) layered over Tailwind. 
Match this existing aesthetic — clean, card-based, financial dashboard look 
with rounded corners, soft shadows, and good whitespace.

## CONTEXT
The app is a multi-currency digital wallet platform (similar to Payoneer / Wise). 
Users already have wallets and can send vouchers. Now we're adding "Gift Cards" 
— a premium upgrade over plain vouchers, with designed templates, recipient 
personalization, and emotional appeal.

## SCREENS NEEDED (5 total)

### Screen 1 — Gift Card Landing / Index Page
- Hero banner with tagline "Send the perfect gift, instantly"
- 3 stat cards at top: "Sent: 12", "Received: 5", "Total Value: $450"
- Tabbed interface: [Sent Gift Cards] [Received] [Redeemed]
- Each gift card shown as a horizontal mini-card with:
  * Left: small template thumbnail (80x80)
  * Middle: recipient name, amount, status badge (Pending/Delivered/Redeemed/Expired)
  * Right: action menu (View, Resend, Cancel)
- Primary CTA button top-right: "Create Gift Card" + secondary "Redeem Code"
- Empty state with friendly illustration when no cards

### Screen 2 — Create Gift Card (Main flow, 4-step wizard, single page)
- Page title with breadcrumb
- Step 1: TEMPLATE GALLERY
  * Category filter chips: All, Birthday, Holiday, Thank You, Anniversary, Congratulations
  * Grid of 8-12 gift card design thumbnails (3-4 per row)
  * Each thumbnail shows the design preview with hover effect
  * Selected template gets a colored border/checkmark
- Step 2: AMOUNT & WALLET
  * Wallet selector dropdown (shows wallet name + available balance)
  * Amount input with currency symbol
  * Quick amount buttons: $25, $50, $100, $200, Custom
  * Min/max limit hint below
- Step 3: RECIPIENT DETAILS
  * Toggle: "Send to existing Digikash user" / "Send to anyone via email"
  * Recipient name input
  * Recipient email (with autocomplete if Digikash user)
  * Custom message textarea (200 char limit, with counter)
  * Sender name (auto-filled, editable)
  * Optional: Schedule delivery (date/time picker)
- Step 4: LIVE PREVIEW + SUMMARY (sticky right sidebar)
  * Realistic gift card preview that updates live as user types
  * Shows: template design, amount, "To: Recipient", "From: Sender", message
  * Summary list: Amount, Fee, Total, Conversion rate, Payable amount
  * Big CTA button: "Send Gift Card"

### Screen 3 — Gift Card Preview (Public/Recipient view)
- Beautiful centered card on gradient background
- Animated reveal effect (envelope opening / confetti)
- Shows full gift card design
- "From [Sender]" with avatar
- Custom message in elegant typography
- Big amount displayed prominently
- Gift code in copyable monospace pill
- CTA: "Redeem Now" (if user logged in) OR "Sign up to redeem"
- Footer: expiry date, terms link

### Screen 4 — Redeem Gift Card
- Centered single-column card
- Large code input field (formatted like XXXX-XXXX-XXXX with auto-uppercase)
- "Verify Code" button → reveals card preview + amount → "Redeem to Wallet" button
- Wallet selector if multiple currencies
- Success state with confetti animation showing new balance

### Screen 5 — Admin: Gift Card Template Manager
- Standard admin table layout matching existing backend pages
- Columns: Thumbnail, Name, Category, Status, Sort Order, Actions
- Top: "Add Template" button, Search, Category filter
- Modal/page for create/edit:
  * Image upload (with preview)
  * Name, Category dropdown, Background color picker, Text color picker
  * Live preview pane

## DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
- Color palette: Use existing project colors (primary/base color, success green, 
  warning amber, danger red). Tailwind with neutral grays.
- Typography: Clean sans-serif. Money amounts should be bold and larger.
- Cards: rounded-2xl borders, subtle box-shadow, white backgrounds
- Buttons: btn-base (primary), btn-light-success (secondary actions)
- Icons: use icons consistent with the financial/wallet theme (gift box, envelope, sparkles)
- The gift card design itself should feel premium — like a real physical card
- Mobile responsive: stack everything vertically on mobile, wizard becomes steps
- Use Alpine.js for: step transitions, live preview updates, template selection

## ACCESSIBILITY
- All form fields have visible labels
- Color contrast WCAG AA
- Keyboard navigable wizard
- ARIA labels on icon-only buttons

## ANIMATIONS (Tailwind/Alpine)
- Smooth template card hover scale
- Wizard step transitions (slide)
- Confetti/sparkle on successful gift creation
- Envelope opening animation on recipient preview

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Provide:
1. Full Blade template code for each screen using Tailwind utilities + the 
   existing class names (col-lg-*, single-form-card, card-main, btn-base, 
   summery-list, etc.)
2. Alpine.js x-data blocks for interactive state
3. Mobile-responsive variants
4. A reusable <x-gift-card-design> component for the visual card itself

<!-- The user explicitly selected the following skills for this project, as attachments to their message. These are not optional context — they define how you work. Use them. -->
<attached-skill name="Design System (design system)">
[Design System] This project uses the **Design System** design system. This is a binding choice for visual style — every visual must follow it. Don't invent colors, type, spacing, or components not grounded here.

Scope: the design system is a visual style reference only. Its guide may describe example products, brands, or people that are unrelated to the user and unrelated to the subject of this conversation. Never treat anything in the design system as a fact about the user, their work, or the topic they asked about.

    Explore it to find what you need:
    - Always copy out the fonts and colors you need
    - For prototypes and designs, always copy out any relevant components
    - If the design system contains existing mocks of products, and you were asked to design or prototype something similar, copy and fork those mocks to start your design. This helps you make high-quality designs.
    
    Explore it quickly to find relevant UI kits (e.g. mocks of existing products you can copy and fork)

Full system at `/projects/9b84a0ea-2c51-4195-81f6-803c6362af89/`. Before producing any visuals, explore it: call `list_files("/projects/9b84a0ea-2c51-4195-81f6-803c6362af89/")` to see the structure, then `read_file` the README/base.md or whatever index file it has. Don't guess at the design system's contents.

CSS tokens: the guide may describe tokens in prose, but the exact `--*` names are defined in the design system's stylesheet(s). Before writing any `var(--*)`, look up the real name in the design system's `.css` files (`list_files` + `read_file` under `/projects/9b84a0ea-2c51-4195-81f6-803c6362af89/`). Never guess a token name — an unresolved `var()` silently falls back to the browser default.

For assets and UI kits beyond the guide: `read_file("/projects/9b84a0ea-2c51-4195-81f6-803c6362af89/<path>")` and `copy_files` to bring them into the current project.

I have great context — DigiKash's blue/navy fintech palette is already established in the banner work, and your brief is extremely detailed. I'll dive in and build all 5 screens as a single design canvas (rather than five loose files) so you can compare them side-by-side and zoom into any one. I'll also add a "Gift Card Templates" section showing the reusable card component in 6 design variants.

_[tool: copy_starter_component]_

_[tool: write_file]_

Now I'll build the shared design tokens and the reusable Gift Card visual component first, then each screen.

_[tool: write_file]_

_[tool: write_file]_

Now the shared chrome (sidebar, topbar, icons) used by every authenticated screen:

_[tool: write_file]_

Now Screen 1 — the landing/index:

_[tool: write_file]_

Now Screen 2 — the 4-step wizard. It's interactive (stepper is clickable so users can flip between all 4 steps):

_[tool: write_file]_

Screen 3 — the public recipient preview (gradient background, envelope reveal effect):

_[tool: write_file]_

Screen 4 — Redeem (3 states: input → verified → success):

_[tool: write_file]_

Screen 5 — Admin template manager (table + edit drawer):

_[tool: write_file]_

Now wire everything into the main design canvas:

_[tool: show_html]_

_[tool: done]_

_[tool: update_todos]_

_[tool: fork_verifier_agent]_

Five screens are ready on a single design canvas — open any artboard fullscreen to focus.

**What you got**
- **01 Index** — hero banner, 3 stat cards, tabs (Sent / Received / Redeemed), horizontal mini-card rows
- **02 Create** — clickable 4-step wizard (Design → Amount → Recipient → Review) with sticky live-preview + order summary sidebar
- **03 Recipient** — gradient public view with confetti, animated reveal, message, copyable code pill, Redeem/Sign-up CTAs
- **04 Redeem** — three states toggleable in the corner: `input` (code field) → `verified` (card + wallet picker) → `success` (new balance + confetti)
- **05 Admin** — table (thumb · name · category · status · sort · used · actions) with editing drawer (image upload, color pickers, live preview)
- **`<GiftCardDesign>`** — reusable visual component, 6 templates: Birthday, Holiday, Thank You, Anniversary, Congratulations, Premium

**Following your brief**
- DigiKash blue/navy primary, success-green/warning-amber/danger-red state colors, Plus Jakarta Sans
- Class names match your existing backend: `single-form-card`, `summery-list` (with the intentional misspelling), `btn-base`, `btn-light-success`, `form-control`, `form-label`, `chip`, `card-main`, `badge-*`, `stat-card`, `tabs`, `tbl`, `stepper`
- Tokens in `gift-cards/tokens.css` are CSS variables so they map cleanly to your Tailwind theme

**Next steps when you're ready**
- Convert each screen to actual Blade partials + Tailwind utility classes (the structure is already 1:1)
- Wire up real Alpine.js `x-data` for wizard step / template selection / code formatting
- Replace template thumbnails with admin-uploaded JPGs
